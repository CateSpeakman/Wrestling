        <h1>Let's Talk Wrestling</h1>
        <p> A few year's ago we were going on vacation and being the Indy wrestling fan that I am, i wanted to know  if there were any local shows.  But there was only 1 problem.  I didnt know the names of any of the compannies in the surrounding areas. At that time the idea for this site was emerged.</p>
